</p>

**Gitzzeria** is a full-stack, real-time canteen management platform designed to revolutionize the campus dining experience. Built with a focus on speed, security, and user-centric design, Gitzzeria provides a seamless digital interface for both students and administrators. Users can browse a live menu, place orders, and receive real-time status updates, while admins get a powerful dashboard to manage operations, from order fulfillment to analytics.

This project was built from the ground up, migrating from an older architecture to a modern, scalable stack using **React (Vite), TypeScript, Firebase, and ShadCN UI**.
